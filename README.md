# Simple Cipher

This is a basic command-line tool written in C that implements the classic Caesar cipher
encryption and decryption. It lets you encrypt and decrypt text by shifting letters by a 
specified number of positions in the alphabet. It leaves non-alphabetic characters untouched. 
Think of it as a beginner-friendly encryption toy.
